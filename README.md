Course Review and What I learned

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem we solved during the course was to find a data structure solution that allowed us to store file information into a structure that could later be accessed based specifically on what the user entered and desired to see. This was done through multiple stages of pseudocode, big-O notation analysis and experience gained from the course. In the end, while a vector may have seemed like the optimum choice for the final project, I chose to use a Binary Search Tree structure as it did require the extra programming to sort the items as a vector and just made more sense to avoid maintence tasks later down the road after deployment.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached by the problem by researching each structures advantages and disadvantages, while also considering their performance when compared to one another. I had ample help from my instructor, whom I reached out to any time I was struggling to grasp a concept or found myself getting stuck on issue or delving to deep into the muck with the details. I find it extremely useful and productive to ask questions when we have them, rather than to spend hours upon hours trying to solve something that could be solved within minutes with the right guidance. I was previously unaware of how important data structures were, especially related to performance and run-time efficiency. Having completed this course, I have a much better understanding of why it is so important to consider all available data structures on an individual projects basis, versus always choosing to use one structure as just because it the one you are most familiar with. By considering the options and weighing which one would perform best in each instance, you ultimately provide the client with a higher performing and better quality product.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I am finally... learning to pace myself, versus trying to muddle through an entire project in one sitting, regardless of overload or fatigue. I know that when we are stuck, we are told to walk away, but, this was something I did not actually implement until this term. Also, the importance of version control. Something that I am consistently utilizing at work, but when it came to my assignments, I had the tendency to not like the way something was working, or not working, and would delete everything and start from scratch. This is not an efficient practice as it wasted countless hours on redundancy. Now, instead of deleting everything, I save it as version 1, then take the pieces that are working from my program and pull them to a new program where I adjust, only the issues. Also, again, I cannot stress the importance of asking for guidance when needed. Not to say over every menial item you have a question with, such as something that google could solve, but when you are truly stuck, have tried several approaches to avail, then, reach out to someone who can offer insight. Also, when reaching out, do not ask for them to tell you how to do it, just enough to details to get you back on track.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This course has likely been the most impactful of all I have taken so far. While previous courses went through pseudocode and designing or modeling your product, they were very formal and "matter of fact" with their literature, which I found stiffling, therefore avoided doing. This course and the instructor allowed to create pseudocode more as I see the way designs should be, which is thoughts and approaches you could take, without getting so hung up on the details. While uniformity is important when following something such as industry best practice standards, knowing that my pseudocode is written for myself to refer back to for guidance when developing my product has helped me immensely. Now instead of avoiding pseudocode, or it taking me 12-13 tries to get it to where I think it is acceptable, I can freely write it and actually use it to develop my program, whereas before, I completed it due to it being an assignment, and never looked at it again when developing my programs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The main difference in my program writing is my thought and thinking ahead of time. Before this course I would "dive in head first" so to speak on every project and program, with little to no thought of whether I was choosing the best structure or process for the program. While all of my programs worked, I feel had I received the same type of education from other courses as this course, I would have spent less time just "winging" it, as I would have had a greater understanding of what to consider when developing my program. I now stop and write down the purpose of the program, what features are required, and what features are optional. I also consider which approach will provide the most efficient run-time without sacrificing features. Also, I had the habbit of hard-coding most everything, and did not truly understand what that meant when other instructors would mention or deduct points with a notation stating I had hard-coded something. While I understood what hard-coding something was, I was not sure how to "not" do that, or even the reason why that was not a good practice. I now understand that for a program to be adaptable and maintainable, one needs to choose something other than hard-coding whenever possible, otherwise, you have to change your entire program, instead of only changing a line or two or automating the process to where your program handles changes and adapts accordingly.

Instructor Availability and Response Time
Your class interaction with the instructor and your classmates will take place on a regular, ongoing basis. Your instructor will be actively engaged within the course throughout the week. You will normally communicate with your instructor in the weekly discussions or the General Questions discussion topic so that your questions and the instructor’s answers benefit the entire class. You should feel free, however, to communicate with your instructor via SNHU email at any time, particularly when you want to discuss something of a personal or sensitive nature. Your instructor will generally provide a response within 24 hours. Instructors will post grades and feedback (as applicable) within seven days of an assignment’s due date, or within seven days of a late submission.
